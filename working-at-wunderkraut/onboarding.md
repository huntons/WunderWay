When new people join our team it's important that they all receive the same warm welcome. If you've been chosen to welcome the next intake then here is a handy list to help you with your warm welcome.

## Before Joining

* Create a Staff folder using the [template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgWVJLdmxHX0wzSUU) in the same folder
* Get contracts signed digitally via DocuSign and store in the staff folder
* Record personal details in the [Staff Record](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vG5_lLttCYsGUMtiwOv94y80-mu1r60ykRsGGNg7Gt8/edit#gid=0)
* Send an email to Finance to let them know the person's name, start date, salary and contact number/email. Finance will handle payroll
* Create a record in the [Phone Book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1StftpHFFopnb8TBMcqiEsEmEFDjQ5kKxuobKYHkAbqA/edit), [Holiday and Sickness log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iyiTnYuVaJuOxN3cseon5Sj6kQS2rVIK3LAI76cgvnA/edit#gid=3) and the [Training and Conference log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8WHrOFKOOa_Ig0GGnf5Wt1p8YE3wlWuJid0HO_UkfI/edit#gid=2)
* Arrange the order of a laptop, a SIP phone and business cards
* Agree a buddy within the team and point the buddy towards their [Being a Buddy](/working-at-wunderkraut/buddies/being/) checklist

## First Day

When a new person joins the team their buddy will make all of the necessary introductions and get them set up. 

Read [Being a Buddy](/working-at-wunderkraut/buddies/being/) to find out what they'll take the new staff through.

New staff can find out more about the buddy role at [Having a Buddy](/working-at-wunderkraut/buddies/having/)

## First Week

In your first week we'll do all we can to help get you settled in, introduced around the group and beginning to contribute. Your first week will include some, or all, of the following depending on your role:

* We'll organise a time for you to meet face-to-face with your buddy. Whether you're new to remote working or not, it's important to see real people when you first join
* If possible, we'll organise a social night with other members of the team and we'll invite people from other country offices if they're available
* We'll organise an onboarding retrospective at the end of the first few weeks so you can let us know what's going well and what's not going so well
* Where possible, we'll get you involved with a client so that you get to see us in action, how we work and our relationships with those who pay the bills
* We'll ask you some personal (though not too personal) questions that we'll include in our group-wide email to all staff to help them get to know you better
* At the end of the week we'll ask you to review our processes for onboarding new staff while it's fresh in your mind. We're always looking for ways to do everything better and this will be a great opportunity for you to contribute to our WunderWay

It's important that your first week is productive, that you get to see the real 'us', that you have fun and that you get to feel you made the right decision in joining the team.
